<h2>Idea Behind our Project</h2>
<p>Often there are times, when one needs a rough pad while on computer just for jotting down ideas in his/her mind or just for sketching. Our project provides you with an easy to use virtual scribble board to put your thoughts onto and implement them easily while increasing your efficiency ! Our scribble board provides a user with numerous features :</p>

<h3> Tools </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Brush : A tool for scribbling free hand on the board. Just drag on the board and the corresponding path will be drawn with the selected colour, transparency and line width </li>
  <li> Eraser : A tool for erasing the contents on the screen. Just drag on the board and the corresponding path will be erased with the selected line width </li>
  <li> TextBox : A tool for writing text on the the screen. Enter the text to be written in the text box which appears at the bottom left corner of your screen. Make sure to enter \n at the end of each line to indicate the presence of a new line. Clicking on the drawing screen will draw the text on the board with the selected colour, transparency and line width</li>
  <li> Line : A tool for drawing lines across the board. Just drag on the board and the corresponding line between the starting point and the finish point will be drawn with the selected colour, transparency and line width </li>
  <li> Rectangle: A tool for drawing rectangles across the board. Just drag on the board and the corresponding rectangle between the starting point and the finish point will be drawn with the selected colour, transparency and line width</li>
  <li> Ellipse: A tool for drawing ellipses across the board. Just drag on the board and the corresponding ellipse between the starting point and the finish point will be drawn with the selected colour, transparency and line width </li>
  <li> Clear Screen : A tool for clearing out the board screen. Just click on the tool to clear the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p> Note - Only one tool can be selected at once</p>

<h3> Colours And Transparency</h3>
<p> Our board provides a user with an option to choose from a total of 16,777,216 colour combinations. These combinations can be selected by chosing the respective RGB component by clicking on the red, green and blue bar provided above the tools. An arrow at the bottom of each bar indicates the current red, green, or blue component chosen. The left most position indicates a value of 0 and the right most position indicates a value of 255. The corresponding colour formed by selecting the RGB values is shown in a square, present at at the left of the red colour bar. The default colur on loading the scribble board is white.</p>
<p>Similarly a bar has been provided for controlling the transparency of the colour selected. The left most position indicates full transparency where as the right most position indicates full opacity.</p>
<p>These colour combinations along with the transparency can be selected and used with brush tool, textbox tool, line tool, rectangle tool and ellipse tool.</p>

<h3>Line Width</h3>
<p> Our board also provides with an option to choose the line width while using brush tool, eraser tool, textbox tool, line tool, rectangle tool and ellipse tool. This width can range from 0.1 to 30. The default value for it is 0.1. To change the line width for any tool, click on the the bar containing '+' and '-' symbols at it's ends. An arrow at the bottom of the bar indicates the value chosen. The corresponding width along with the colour is previewed as a circle on the right of the bar.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p> We began implementing our project by dividing the canvas into 2 parts, one part for the board where the drawing occurs and the other for the tools and colour,transparency and line width selection. Then we made rectangles for each of the tools and selections and coloured them accordingly and added some images of different tools to the corresponding tools. We made an event listener which tracks the clicking down of mouse. It has various conditions for tracking where the mouse is clicked. If the mouse is clicked on a tool the tool gets selected, if it is clicked on the selection bars then relative to where it is clicked on the bar the RGB value, the transparency value and the line width is set. If the mouse is clicked on the scribbling area, then another event listener which gets activated whenever the mouse is moved checks which tool is currently selected and according to the properties of that tool action is taken on the scribbling board. Another event listener checks when the mouse click is released.</p>
<p> To implement the draw and erase tools a function was defined under the mousemove event which draws a line to the current x and y values of the mouse with the selected colour, transparency and line width. If erase tool is selected the colour is set to the background colour.
</p>

<p>For the textbox tool, while most directions were pointing to using dialog boxes to take input, doing it in html seemed like the more aesthetic choice. As mentioned before, when the textbox tool is selected, it will trigger a flag. When this is on, the textbox (accessed by id) will appear and will keep taking input from it. This value of the input would be drawn to the canvas wherever the current x and y are (using similar listeners). the font size and color are adjusted by varying the parameters controlled by the sliders. 

<h2>Learnt from project</h2>

<p>This project paved for the chance to learn about JavaScript , HTML , and a bit of CSS languages. The implementation of the canvas tool helped in recognising its wide potential in developing a UI for a page with ease. Working together with good communications made it much faster and effecient as debugging was not a tough task with someone reviewing your code. Additionally it was a good test run for using github. The project made sure to instigate curiosity in what one can do in web development. It was a good experience and will make sure to keep us motivated in this field.</p>
